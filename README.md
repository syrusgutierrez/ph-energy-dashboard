### Project Overview

This project analyzes 20 years of historical data (2003–2023) from DOE generation and capacity reports to understand how the Philippine energy mix has evolved.
It highlights:
* Total grid generation growth
* Installed capacity expansion
* Renewable vs. non-renewable distribution
* Top energy contributors
* Island group and year-level dynamics

The result is an interactive dashboard that gives users clear visibility on how the country’s power mix has changed over time — and where it is heading.
