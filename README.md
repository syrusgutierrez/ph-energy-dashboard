## **Philippine Energy Dashboard (2003–2023)**
A Data Analytics Portfolio Project by Sy

This project analyzes two decades of power generation and installed capacity data in the Philippines. The goal is to understand long-term trends, compare energy sources, and visualize how the national energy mix has evolved all through a fully interactive Power BI dashboard.

## **Project Overview**

Using official DOE datasets, this project:
* Combines generation and capacity data from multiple regions
* Cleans and restructures data for analysis
* Applies DAX to compute key metrics (YoY change, source share, RE share, etc.)
* Builds a professional Power BI dashboard with filters for:
  * Island Group
  * Year
  * Energy Source

This project showcases my ability to work with real datasets, build end-to-end analytics workflows, and transform raw numbers into meaningful insights.

## **Key Features**

### Interactive Power BI Dashboard

* Dynamic KPI cards with YoY changes
* Generation trends across 20 years
* Installed capacity comparison
* Source share contribution
* Top 3 energy sources per filter
* RE vs Fossil share analysis

### Notable Insights

* The country’s total grid generation nearly doubled from 2003 to 2023
* Coal remained the dominant fuel source across all regions
* Renewables grew steadily, especially solar in later years
* Luzon consistently contributed over 70% of the national generation
* Capacity expansion aligned with rising demand and shifting energy mix

### 🧠 **About This Project**

This is the first project in my portfolio as I transition into data analytics.
It reflects the full workflow, from raw data to a polished dashboard and serves as a foundation for more complex projects involving business, operations, and real-world analytics.
